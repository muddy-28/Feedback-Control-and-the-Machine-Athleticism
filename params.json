Quadcopters are considered rotocraft due to the fact that their lift is achieved by a set of revolving narrow chord airfoils. Quadcopters use symmetrically pitched blades unlike helicopters. The vehicle motion of the quadcopter is controlled by altering the pitch and rotation rate of one or more rotor discs, which in turn changes the torque load and lift characteristics. Quadcopters have various models available. The quadcopter is used for military purposes, security to recreational flying. Quadcopters are small in size and have great maneuverability, which make them great for indoor and outdoor flying.\r\n\r\n##Algorithm\r\nis the magic that brings quadcopters to life. The control theory is what creates algorithm and in turn controls the quadcopter. The key to the acrobatic movements is also the algorithm. The way this is brought forth is by the mathematical model in the system in order for the maneuvers to take place. Some high performance tasks are easier than others.\r\n\r\n##Quadcopter-holding-champaign-glass-upMathematical\r\nmodels are also used to replay things 50 times per second. An exciting development, known as commercial gesture sensor, was demonstrated to show a natural way of interacting with quads simply using gestures. With his arms how one can control the movements of the quadcopter. Interaction also doesn’t have to be virtual, but it can be physical. With the use of mathematical models, one can physically interact with quads and change the laws of physics. Also, sports and athleticism are used to create new algorithms for machines.\r\n\r\n##Athleticism is the control of power. \r\nIn moving beyond simple aerial acrobatics to high speed ballistic maneuvers that happen faster than the eye can follow, the new drone athletes literally carve the sky. The low level control techniques used in drones have been around in basic form for some time. They allow drones to do some pretty incredible flight maneuvers, like controlled hover in wind, pole balancing acts, or flying in close formation. With the adoption of increasing power to weight (and drag) ratios, drones now have the capability to perform manuevers so quickly that the end result of a control loop is not predictable on a relevant timescale. A new form of meta-control, that involves self-teaching through trial and error, has come to the rescue.\r\n\r\n-> Quadrotor will be able to react on the basis of the environment and situsations.\r\n\r\n-> Quadrotor will be calibrate with fails safe algorithms and repond overload algorithms as well\r\n\r\n##Proposal Of FYP\r\n#Introduction:\r\nQuadcopter is a multirotor helicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors. This is also known as quadrotor helicopter or quadrotor. It uses two sets of identical pitched propellers.  Two of them rotate clockwise (CW) and two counter clockwise (CCW). It is used to overcome persistent problems in vertical flight and torque induced control issues.\r\nQuadcopter designs are used in unnamed aerial vehicles research.  These vehicles use electronic control systems and electronic sensors to stabilize the aircraft.\r\nState Of Art & Citations:\r\n#Quadcopters are useful tool in university research to test and evaluate new ideas including:\r\n•\tFlight Control Theory\r\n•\tNavigation\r\n•\tReal Time System\r\n•\tRobotics\r\n\r\n###A recent project inspires us which perform some cool tricks in specified arena with Quadcopter.\r\nLink:          http://flyingmachinearena.org/research/\r\n\r\n##Our Idea:\r\nRecently flying activity of quadcopter presented in cite is in a specific arena. It is costly too.\r\nThe goal of project is to catch a ball with intelligence. We will attempt to catch the ball with the Quadcopter by using Kinect device for ball detection.Some feed back control systems are used to handle the Copter movements during catching the ball.\r\nOur concept can be further extended to a bullet shield. This shield will protect target by sensing and catching fired bullet with optimized algorithms.\r\n\r\n###\r\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/132900424?color=c9ff23\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/132900424\">Demo Autonomous Robot Path Finding</a> from <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/user41817016\">Adnan Shafique</a> on <a href=\"https://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p> <p></p>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
