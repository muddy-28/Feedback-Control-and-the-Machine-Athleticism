A Quadcopter is a multicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors.  Quadcopters are considered rotocraft due to the fact that their lift is achieved by a set of revolving narrow chord airfoils.  Quadcopters use symmetrically pitched blades unlike helicopters.  The vehicle motion of the quadcopter is controlled by altering the pitch and rotation rate of one or more rotor discs, which in turn changes the torque load and lift characteristics.  Quadcopters have various models available.  The quadcopter is used for military purposes, security to recreational flying.  Quadcopters are small in size and have great maneuverability, which make them great for indoor and outdoor flying.

Algorithm is the magic that brings quadcopters to life.  The control theory is what creates algorithm and in turn controls the quadcopter.  The key to the acrobatic movements is also the algorithm.  The way this is brought forth is by the mathematical model in the system in order for the maneuvers to take place.  Some high performance tasks are easier than others.

The quadcopter can in fact perform with damage in an unconventional way of flying.  It still has roll, pitch and acceleration that can be controlled by algorithm in order to fly.  In addition to that, how a machine can do what an athlete can do without effort was brought forth.  First and foremost, one needs to figure out where the ball is going and next where the quad should be.  Machines can not only do maneuvers on their own, but can also do them collectively.

An exciting development, known as commercial gesture sensor, was demonstrated to show a natural way of interacting with quads simply using gestures. With his arms how one can control the movements of the quadcopter.  Interaction also doesnâ€™t have to be virtual, but it can be physical.  With the use of mathematical models, one can physically interact with quads and change the laws of physics.  Also, sports and athleticism are used to create new algorithms for machines.

Athleticism is the control of power. In moving beyond simple aerial acrobatics to high speed ballistic maneuvers that happen faster than the eye can follow, the new drone athletes literally carve the sky. The low level control techniques used in drones have been around in basic form for some time. They allow drones to do some pretty incredible flight maneuvers, like controlled hover in wind, pole balancing acts, or flying in close formation. With the adoption of increasing power to weight (and drag) ratios, drones now have the capability to perform manuevers so quickly that the end result of a control loop is not predictable on a relevant timescale. A new form of meta-control, that involves self-teaching through trial and error, has come to the rescue.

-> Quadrotor will be able to react on the basis of the environment and situsations.

-> Quadrotor will be calibrate with fails safe algorithms and repond overload algorithms as well

-> Quadrotor will be able it will be reciving the input and selection of diffrent atheltic menuvaurs Failsafe Algo would 
work according to the value sets like when it will goes down to 4 feet it will react and pull it about 5 feet high in air and make it sure it blanced and satble failsafe algorith will also work over of auto recover sheild.
fail safe algorithm will be able to handle quad until its 2 proples are still working and performing according to demand.
all grvity meunavurs will be basis on physics reactions and also be following the mathematics rule and theorise like
