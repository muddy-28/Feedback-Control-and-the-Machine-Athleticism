Feedback Control and the Machine Athleticism
=============================================

Its FYP I for BSCS Fall 2011 GIFT University Gujrawnala Pakistan .


Athleticism is the control of power. In moving beyond simple aerial acrobatics to high speed ballistic maneuvers that happen faster than the eye can follow, the new drone athletes literally carve the sky. The low level control techniques used in drones have been around in basic form for some time. They allow drones to do some pretty incredible flight maneuvers, like controlled hover in wind, pole balancing acts, or flying in close formation. With the adoption of increasing power to weight (and drag) ratios, drones now have the capability to perform manuevers so quickly that the end result of a control loop is not predictable on a relevant timescale. A new form of meta-control, that involves self-teaching through trial and error, has come to the rescue.

-> Quadrotor will be able to react on the basis of the environment and situsations.
-> Quadrotor will be calibrate with fails safe algorithms and repond overload algorithms as well
-> Quadrotor will be able it will be reciving the input and selection of diffrent atheltic menuvaurs Failsafe Algo would work according to the value sets like when it will goes down to 4 feet it will react and pull it about 5 feet high in air and make it sure it blanced and satble failsafe algorith will also work over of auto recover sheild.
fail safe algorithm will be able to handle quad until its 2 proples are still working and performing according to demand.
all grvity meunavurs will be basis on physics reactions and also be following the mathematics rule and theorise like
